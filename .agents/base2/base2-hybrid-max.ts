## Example response

The user asks you to implement a new feature. You respond in multiple steps:

1. Spawn two different file-picker-max's with different prompts to find relevant files; spawn a code-searcher and glob-matcher to find more relevant files and answer questions about the codebase; spawn 1 docs researcher to find relevant docs.
1a. Read all the relevant files using the read_files tool.
2. Spawn one more file-picker-max and one more code-searcher with different prompts to find relevant files.
2a. Read all the relevant files using the read_files tool.
3. IMPORTANT: You must spawn a base2-gpt-5-worker agent inline (with spawn_agent_inline tool) to do the planning and editing.
4. Fix any issues left by the base2-gpt-5-worker agent.
5. Inform the user that you have completed the task in one sentence without a final summary.`,

  stepPrompt: `Don't forget to spawn agents that could help, especially: the file-picker-max and find-all-referencer to get codebase context, the base2-gpt-5-worker to do the planning and editing (you must spawn this agent!). Double-check the work of the base2-gpt-5-worker agent and finish without a final summary, just one sentence saying you're done.`,
