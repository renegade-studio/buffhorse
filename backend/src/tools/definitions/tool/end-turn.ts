Only use this tool to hand control back to the user.

- When to use: after you have completed a meaningful chunk of work and you are either (a) fully done, or (b) explicitly waiting for the user's next message.
- Do NOT use: as a stop token mid-work, to pause between tool calls, to wait for tool results, or to "check in" unnecessarily.
- Before calling: finish all pending steps, resolve tool results, and include any outputs the user needs to review.
- Effect: Signals the UI to wait for the user's reply; any pending tool results will be ignored.

*INCORRECT USAGE*:
${getToolCallString('some_tool_that_produces_results', { query: 'some example search term' }, false)}

${getToolCallString(toolName, {})}

*CORRECT USAGE*:
All done! Would you like some more help with xyz?

${getToolCallString(toolName, {})}

    `.trim(),
