In general, we reevaulate plans day-by-day and thus the roadmap may change at any point.

As of Oct 6th, here's what we're working on:
- Brandon is rebuilding npm-app from the ground up with a snazzy TUI and reusing the SDK instead of a custom connection to the backend
- Charles is moving backend logic to the SDK so more code is run locally. 
- James is building more powerful agents, especially "base2", which is the next-gen default codebuff agent. Try it with `codebuff --experimental`!
