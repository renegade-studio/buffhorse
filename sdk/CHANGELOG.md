# Changelog

All notable changes to the @codebuff/sdk package will be documented in this file.

## [0.4.3]

### Added

- Exported `processToolCallBuffer` and state helpers so SDK consumers can strip `<codebuff_tool_call>` segments mid-stream.
- CLI now consumes the shared helper to avoid leaking XML when responses arrive without token streaming.
- Extra regression tests covering multi-chunk tool-call payloads based on the CLI log case ("I'll help you commit").

## [0.4.2]

### Added

- XML tool call filtering in stream chunks - filters out `<codebuff_tool_call>` tags while preserving response text
- Stateful parser handles tags split across chunk boundaries
- 50-character safety buffer for split tag detection
- Comprehensive unit tests (17 test cases)

## [0.3.1]

- `CodebuffClient.run` now does not return `null`. Instead, the `CodebuffClient.run(...).output.type` will be `'error'`.

## [0.3.0]

- New more intuitive interface for `CodebuffClient` and `CodebuffClient.run`.

## [0.1.30]

Types updates.

## [0.1.20]

- You can now retrieve the output of an agent in `result.output` if result is the output of an awaited `client.run(...)` call.
- cwd is optional in the CodebuffClient constructor.
- You can pass in `extraToolResults` into a run() call to include more info to the agent.

## [0.1.17]
